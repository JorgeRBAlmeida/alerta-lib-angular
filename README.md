# AngularProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.15.

## Development server

First, to simulate the api you have to install json-server `npm i -g json-server`. Then to make it run use the command `json-server --watch db.json`.

Second, before you serve the project you have to build the alerta library by using the command `ng build alerta --watch`.

In this project you have to choose the project to serve. Run `ng serve alerta-viewer` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
